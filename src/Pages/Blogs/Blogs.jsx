                    <li>SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.</li>
                    <li>SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.</li>
                    <li>SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.</li>
                    <li>  SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.</li>

                <p className="text-neutral">
                    JWT  or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued <br /><br />

                    JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

It is a used as backend service where javascript works on the server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on both frontend and backend. Node.js runs on chrome v8 engine which converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and data-intensive.<br />

NodeJS server has an internal component referred to as the EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. This EventLoop is single threaded.t.<br />
